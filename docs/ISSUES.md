# Known issues

Found on 2026-10-05 during the council review of business value. Each entry: what breaks, how it was confirmed, status.

## 1. Amounts next to Chinese characters are not extracted

- `api/guard.py` `extract_numbers` uses `\b`. In Python's Unicode regex, CJK characters are word characters, so there is no word boundary in 「新台幣50,000元」.
- Confirmed: `extract_numbers('採購金額超過新台幣50,000元者，5萬元以下')` returns `[]`. Amounts written as 「5萬」 are also not understood.
- Effect: threshold checks (guard check 4) and quote checks fail on Chinese policies, so the stage falls back to the NovaGear fixture.
- Status: open.

## 2. Someone else's documents can come back as NovaGear

- `api/pipeline.py` falls back to the NovaGear fixtures for organization, opportunities and workflow when the guard rejects two answers. The only notice is one grey line in the UI.
- Effect: a judge who uploads their own PDFs may see NovaGear's org chart, which looks like faked output.
- Fix direction: use the fixture only for the NovaGear sample; for other documents show "needs human review" with the guard's problems.
- Status: open.

## 3. Scanned PDFs have no text to check quotes against

- `extract_pdf_text` uses pypdf, which returns no text for image-only PDFs. Every quote check then fails.
- Fix direction: when pypdf returns little or no text, ask Gemini to transcribe the PDF and check quotes against that transcript.
- Status: open, not yet reproduced with a real scanned file.

## 4. Different job titles may be reported as missing roles

- A policy may say "Director" while a real org chart says 協理 or "Head of Procurement". The workflow architect would list the approver as unresolved, which is a false gap.
- Fix direction: a "possible match, please confirm" state instead of a definite gap.
- Status: open, risk only; not yet seen on a real document pair.
